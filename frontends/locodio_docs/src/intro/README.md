# Get started

Initially [locod.io](../about/README.md) was created for __data-modeling__ 
and __code generation__ of PHP Symfony & Doctrine 
backends and Vue.js & Typescript frontends. You will recognize some 
references in the names of the types, relations and in the examples. 
But with some imagination you can develop templates and 
__generate code for all kinds of languages and frameworks__.
Supporting your own style and technologies.

There are two ways to get started with locod.io.
