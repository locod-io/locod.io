# About

__locod.io__ was initially created for data-modeling and code generation
of PHP Symfony & Doctrine backends and Vue.js & Typescript frontends. 
You will recognize some references in the names of the types, 
relations and in the examples.
But with some imagination you can develop templates and
generate code for all kinds of languages and frameworks.
Supporting your own style and technologies.

locod.io is a personal project of 
__Koen Caerels__ ( [<vp-icon icon="fa:linkedin"/>](https://be.linkedin.com/in/koencaerels))
, consolidating all the techniques and 
technologies gathered over the years in creating web applications with a _Domain
Driven Design_ (DDD) and _Command Query Responsibility Segregation_ (CQRS) approach. 
Since this approach requires a lot of coding, the idea was grown to automate and document
the processes involved. Some proof-of-concepts later locod.io was born.

::: tip

[Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) 
(DDD) is a major software design approach, 
focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.
The term was coined by Eric Evans in his book of the same title published in 2003.

[Command Query Responsibility Segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation) 
(CQRS) is an architectural pattern for separating 
reading data (a 'query') from writing to data (a 'command'). CQRS derives from 
Command and Query Separation (CQS), coined by Greg Young.
:::

[v0.1.0](releases.md#v010-initial-release) is the "minimum viable product" version, 
containing the basics for creating 
models, enums, read-models and commands, based on templates that you can develop 
yourself, maintaining you own coding-style and technologies.

### Roadmap

There are plenty more idea's to be further developed in this platform. Eg.
Versioning of the models, importing projects, modules, bulk code generation, generate code directly into
your local project, domain primitives, custom queries, custom commands, writing tests, 
event storming, documentation tools, using the models to generate interfaces, ...
But for developing these a model-maker and code generator would be handy ;-)
Maybe, one day, it will become an open-source low-code platform. 
We will see where the adventure takes us.
