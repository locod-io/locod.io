# Project overview

This is the starting screen of your active project.   
An overview of your __Models__ and __Enums__ are rendered in a
(simplified, non-technical) class diagram.

On the left side you have list of items you can use in your overview.  
With the on/off button you can choose if you want that item in your overview or not.

The other three buttons define the level of detail you want in the overview:
* Only the name
* Basic information: list of fields without type
* Extended information, with types and extra relational properties.

You can save your schema that you have configured in different formats:
* As an image (.png)
* In a vector format (.svg)
* Described in PlantUML syntax (.puml)
