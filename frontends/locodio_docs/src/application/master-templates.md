# Master templates

The __master templates__ is your own __personal library__ of templates.

Here you can provide some extra information about the template, like
a description and some tags. Also you can decide if you want to share
this template with other locod.io users. They are shared anonymously, 
only with your initials and profile color.

Master templates can easily be imported in new projects. [See template](template.md).
