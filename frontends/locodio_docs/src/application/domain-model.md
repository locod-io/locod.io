# Model

A __Model__ (DomainModel, Entity, ...) is the base for modeling data in locod.io.  
With the lightning icon you can prefill the namespace and the repository.

Then you can provide the information for the __Attributions__ (properties) of the model.  
Beneath the fields, you can create and manage the __Associations__ (relations) to other models in your
project.

At the bottom of the page you can choose for which template you want to
generate code for. After choosing a template you can click on the generate button
to see the resulting code.

## Generated code

When code is generated it appears in an overlay screen. Where you can copy the code via 
the copy button. To close this screen, press `esc` or the close button on the 
top right of the screen.

Below you can see an example of a Doctrine Entity (PHP code) 
generated for building this application.
