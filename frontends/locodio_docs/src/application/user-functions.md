# My Account

The __My Account__ functionalities are accessible by clicking
on the user-badge on the top right in the navigation bar.
A dropdown menu will appear where you can choose from following items.  
These are all screens to manage information that is related to your account. 

## My Organisations

__Projects__ are organised within __Organisations__ (or customers).
Here you can add organisations and projects.
Also you can edit the organisation information, the project information
and arrange them like you want. The same configuration will appear on your
starting page.

With the Cloud-icon next to the project name, you can download the information
of your project in json format. _An import function is foreseen in a next release
of locod.io_.
