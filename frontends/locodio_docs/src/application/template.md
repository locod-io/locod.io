# Templates

In this part of the application you can create and change your 
__project templates__.
Choose a name and language, and what kind of type the template 
is (Model, Enum, Query, Command).

Further on the screen you have the editor for coding the template.  
Template are made with Twig. See [making templates](../templates/README.md)

You can quickly test and try a template by saving it, 
and choose a model you want to parse.   
Then click on the __generate__ button.

If you have already some good templates in your own library fitting your project
you can import them via the __import button__ on the left bottom of the screen.

The other way around is also possible, when you are happy with a template. 
You can __export__  it to your master template library for further use
in other project, or share it with other users.

:::tip
A typical workflow for creating templates, is first to create and test them
on __project level__, and then export them to a master template in your library.
In the master template screen you don't have the possibility to try them out.
